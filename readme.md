You did an awesome job on this! The app works great—it pulls in real weather data and the 'favorites' list is a huge win. The best part is using that sunset background with the blurry glass cards makes it look like a high-end. You also made the main temperature big and bold, which makes it super easy to read.

There are just a few small things to fix to make it perfect. Some of the white text is a bit hard to see against the bright clouds, and you have one broken weather icon that isn't showing up. Also, if you make the search bar a little thinner, it will match your original Figma design exactly!

<!-- The Weather Icon isnt broken its just there was only 4  icons to work with only so the correct one wont always be displayed  -->

Everything looks good to me I like how you made it say what the weather is instead of a icon, made the favorite button able to press the star, make the favorite list come up, I like the simplest look make it look like a real website, workers as intend too.
Problems: I notice when you go to 5 day forecast it hard to see all the 5 card as the end two are not kind of going into the corner of the screen, one doesn't produce a image inside the box, maybe change the color because when i search Tokay the favorite list color blends in with the background but beside that it looks good to me.
